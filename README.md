# CUDA-code-for-finding-volume-of-a-hypersphere
Counting the number of grid points within a given hypersphere is helpful in estimating the its volume. This method is described in the book by R. K. Pathria titled "Statistical Mechanics" 

Note: This notebook can be run on Google Colab, which allows to execute CUDA codes just in time.
